 The 6-byte Ethernet address is unique for each interface on an Ethernet and is located at the lower interface of the Ethernet driver.

wild-card destination address of "FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF" (in hexadecimal),   called a "broadcast" address.


 Ethernet uses CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense and Multiple Access with
   Collision Detection).  CSMA/CD means that all devices communicate on
   a single medium, that only one can transmit at a time, and that they
   can all receive simultaneously.  If 2 devices try to transmit at the
   same instant, the transmit collision is detected, and both devices
   wait a random (but short) period before trying to transmit again.


 The translation is done only for outgoing IP
   packets, because this is when the IP header and the Ethernet header
   are created.





     One part of a 4-
   byte IP address is the IP network number, the other part is the IP
   computer number (or host number).
