Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)—AWS offers a load balancer as a service. The Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) distributes traffic to a bunch of servers behind it. It’s highly available by default.


 Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

 Xen Project (pronounced /ˈzɛn/) is a hypervisor using a microkernel design, providing services that allow multiple computer operating systems to execute on the same computer hardware concurrently.


 AWS uses Xen, an open source hypervisor, as the underlying technology for the EC2 service. The current generations of virtual servers on AWS use hardware-assisted vir- tualization. The technology is called Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM) and uses the Intel VT-x platform. A virtual server run by an AMI based on HVM uses a fully virtual- ized set of hardware and can take advantage of hardware extensions that provide fast access to the underlying hardware.
