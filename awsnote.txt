Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)—AWS offers a load balancer as a service. The Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) distributes traffic to a bunch of servers behind it. It’s highly available by default.


 Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

 Xen Project (pronounced /ˈzɛn/) is a hypervisor using a microkernel design, providing services that allow multiple computer operating systems to execute on the same computer hardware concurrently.


 AWS uses Xen, an open source hypervisor, as the underlying technology for the EC2 service. The current generations of virtual servers on AWS use hardware-assisted vir- tualization. The technology is called Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM) and uses the Intel VT-x platform. A virtual server run by an AMI based on HVM uses a fully virtual- ized set of hardware and can take advantage of hardware extensions that provide fast access to the underlying hardware.

Elastic IP addresses for allocating fixed public IP addresses.


 Elastic IPs 


 The infrastructure consists of the following:
■ Load balancer (LB)
■ Virtual servers
■ Database (DB)
■ DNS entry
■ Content delivery network (CDN)
■ Bucket for static files

 Every request you make to the AWS API goes through IAM to check whether the request is allowed.

If you want to reduce the cost of backup storage, you should consider another AWS service: Amazon Glacier.



Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides network-attached, block-level storage with 99.999% availability.

AWS offers tools for building highly available systems based on EC2 instances:
■ Monitoring the health of virtual servers with CloudWatch and triggering recov- ery automatically if needed
■ Building a highly available infrastructure by using multiple isolated data cen- ters, called availability zones, within a region


Recovering from server failure with CloudWatch


1 The physical server’s hardware fails and causes the virtual server to fail as well.
2 The EC2 service detects the outage and reports the failure to CloudWatch metrics.
3 Recovery of the virtual server is triggered by the CloudWatch alarm.
4 The virtual server is launched on another physical host.
5 The EBS volume and Elastic IP stay the same and are linked to the new virtual
server.

The new virtual server is assigned the same ID and public/private IP addresses as the old virtual server and linked to the same EBS volume.
