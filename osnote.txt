hardware interrupt   software interrupt, system call.


When the CPU is interrupted, it stops what it is doing and immediately transfers execution to a fixed location. The fixed location usually contains the starting address where the service routine for the interrupt is located.

More recent architectures store the return address on the system stack. 
 small computer-systems interface (SCSI) controller
 A device controller maintains some local buffer storage and a set of special-purpose registers. 
 device driver  device controller 


 To start an I/O operation, the device driver loads the appropriate registers within the device controller. The device controller, in turn, examines the contents of these registers to determine what action to take (such as “read a character from the keyboard”). The controller starts the transfer of data from the device to its local buffer. Once the transfer of data is complete, the device controller informs the device driver via an interrupt that it has finished its operation. The device driver then returns control to the operating system, possibly returning the data or a pointer to the data if the operation was a read. For other operations, the device driver returns status information.

 The set of jobs in memory can be a subset of the jobs kept in the job pool.

●  A displacement element in the instruction.
●  A base register.
●  An index register. The index register may be automatically multiplied by a scaling factor of 2, 4, or 8.
