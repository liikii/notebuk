   This document describes the protocol elements, along with their
   semantics and encodings, of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP).  LDAP provides access to distributed directory services that
   act in accordance with X.500 data and service models.  These protocol
   elements are based on those described in the X.500 Directory Access
   Protocol (DAP).

 The Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)

Status of this Memo

   This RFC specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" for the standardization state and status
   of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document gives an overview and specification of Version 5 of the
   protocol for the Kerberos network authentication system. Version 4,
   described elsewhere [1,2], is presently in production use at MIT's
   Project Athena, and at other Internet sites.
