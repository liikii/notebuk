Shell> apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
 

On Fedora-based distributions (CentOS, …), the package name is mysql-devel:

Shell> yum install mysql-devel



Example: Build a MySQL client C program
To build a 'c_client.c' program, the following gcc command may be used:

Shell> gcc -o c_client c_client.c -I/usr/include/mysql/  -lmysqlclient
 

An alternative way is to generate the necessary gcc options using the mysql_config command:

Shell> gcc -o c_client c_client.c `mysql_config  --libs --cflags`
